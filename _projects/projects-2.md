**LERA-BFERT** ( Live Emotional Resonance Application based on Facial Expression Recognition Technology) is a real-time facial emotion recognition platform designed to enhance audience engagement in live events and streaming scenarios.

The system detects and aggregates audience emotional responses from live video feeds, providing instant feedback and visualizations for presenters, streamers, or performers.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time facial emotion recognition across multiple faces in a live video stream
- Audience response aggregation and visualization dashboard
- Seamless integration for both live events and online streaming platforms
- Modular design for flexible deployment and customization
