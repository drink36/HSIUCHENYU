**AutoMLOps-Cloud** demonstrates a complete, end-to-end MLOps pipeline for predicting customer purchasing behavior, built on Amazon SageMaker.
The entire workflow—from data processing and feature engineering to model training and deployment—is fully automated and cloud-native, allowing for reproducible, scalable, and maintainable ML operations.

**Key Features:**
- End-to-end automation from data ingestion to prediction storage
- Modular, containerized design supporting local/SageMaker runs
- Fully cloud-native, leveraging S3, Lambda, and Step Functions
- Unified codebase for training, batch inference, and API serving
- Real-world use for business purchase prediction

**System Architecture**

This repository’s core is a fully containerized workflow, allowing for identical model training and inference processes on both local machines and AWS SageMaker.
