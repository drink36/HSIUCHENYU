Hi, I’m Hsiu-Chen YU (Connor), an M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering student at [The Ohio State University](https://cse.osu.edu/), focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

I graduated from [NTUST](https://www.csie.ntust.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en) (B.S. in CSIE) and worked as a Data Analysis Engineer at Artifact Tech, where I developed MLOps pipelines and built cloud-based AI applications.

My main interests are in computer vision and practical machine learning. I’ve worked on projects such as real-time facial emotion recognition and customer purchase prediction, focusing on solving real-world problems with AI.

Outside of tech, you’ll usually find me enjoying games, anime, or cooking something new at home—but I never say no to a good meal or a fun night out with friends.

Feel free to explore my website or connect with me on LinkedIn!
